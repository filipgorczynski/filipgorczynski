# :wave: Hello, folks!

## :man_technologist: About Me

I'm Filip and I wear many hats depending on what is required of me but most of the time I jump between Full Stack Web Developer and Family Guy.

Iâ€™m currently working at Canadian automotive company **Unhaggle** as a Full Stack Engineer using awesome **Django** and lightweight **Vue.js.**

<!-- ## :heartpulse:  My values (TBD)

* Beginner's mindset and curiosity
* Sharing anything I learned -->

## :dart: My 2021Q1 Goals

* Completed and published DJobeet - Django version of Jobeet course introduced originally for Symfony framework
* Finished migration of my personal blog to new platform (Pelican Static Site Generator)
* Published working version of Rathma pet project, publicly accessible
* Completed custom cookiecutter template for starting personal projects with just a few keystrokes

## :seedling: Iâ€™m currently learning... too many things at once

* Godot Engine
* Pixelart
* Basics of electronics (I've already connected battery with a LED and it exploded only once)
* Golang

To be more precise - I'm continuously learning other things as well - including technologies I'm working with on day to day, however I'm still trying to keep in mind that:

> You can do anything, but not everything.

And to be honest I'm not good at it because I'm curious about too many things.

I write my personal thoughts on :gear: Tech & :seedling: Life on my :writing_hand: [Personal Blog](https://blog.filipgorczynski.me/) - more or less regularly.
