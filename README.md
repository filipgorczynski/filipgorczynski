# :wave: Hello, folks!

## :man_technologist: About Me

I'm Filip and I wear many hats depending on what is required of me but most of the time I jump between full stack web developer, family guy & beginner Warhammer 40000 player.

For more than a decade in the industry as a web application developer for a one year I've switched my career path to become a junior game developer in Danish company Omnigame - but finally game development isn't for me. Still, it was really exciting. I'm currently working as a software engineer for a Swiss company - Neoinstinct as I feel more confident with web applications.

:gift: If you'd like to buy me something there is a [short and "curated" wish list](https://blog.filipgorczynski.me/pages/wish-list.html).

* I'm a huge fan of Iron Man and Hulk
* I really enjoyed *Universe of Metro 2033* books series; also a big fan of two books: "Daemon" and "Freedom" written by Daniel Suarez.
* I'm a beginner in Warhammer 40,000 universe (Necrons is my army of choice), terrains building (dungeons) and miniatures painting. And I really :heart: it.
* I write my personal thoughts on :gear: Tech & :seedling: Life on my :writing_hand: [Personal Blog](https://blog.filipgorczynski.me/) - more or less regularly.
