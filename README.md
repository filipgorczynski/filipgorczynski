# :wave: Hello, folks!

## :man_technologist: About Me

I'm Filip and I wear many hats depending on what is required of me but most of the time I jump between full stack web developer, junior game developer and family guy.

Iâ€™m currently working as a junior game developer in Omnigame - game development company from Denmark. Yeah, I've decided to change my career path to try something new.

:gift: If you'd like to buy me something there is a [short and "curated" wish list](https://blog.filipgorczynski.me/pages/wish-list.html).

<!-- ## :heartpulse:  My values (TBD)

* Beginner's mindset and curiosity
* Sharing anything I learned -->

To be more precise - I'm continuously learning other things as well - including technologies I'm working with on day to day, however I'm still trying to keep in mind that:

> You can do anything, but not everything.

And to be honest I'm not good at it because I'm curious about too many things.

I write my personal thoughts on :gear: Tech & :seedling: Life on my :writing_hand: [Personal Blog](https://blog.filipgorczynski.me/) - more or less regularly.
